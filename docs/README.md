# Liquibase AWS Marketplace Extension Deployment and Testing Process

### üöÄ Deploying a test extension to AWS Marketplace

1. Check for update of `liquibase-secure.version`: make sure the latest `liquibase-secure.version` is set in both **pom.xml** and **Dockerfile** before submitting an AWS Marketplace version. Check for any dependabot PR's to be merged.

2. Steps that happen for every SECURE release:

a. `dependabot.yml` checks for new Docker dependencies and `liquibase-secure.version` updates, creating PRs when new versions are released.

b. `dependabot-pr-merge-docker-changes.yml` automatically merges Dependabot PRs for both Docker OSS version updates and liquibase-secure.version changes.

c. Once the Liquibase Secure Docker image is published (from this workflow https://github.com/liquibase/docker/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-release.yml#L546) you must manually trigger `deploy-extension-to-marketplace.yml` in dry_run mode. This publishes a test image to the AWS Marketplace.

d. After AWS Marketplace approval, QA runs the `run-task-definitions.yml` workflow using the test image. If there are no errors, the test image will be restricted automatically as part of the workflow.

e. QA then manually runs `deploy-extension-to-marketplace.yml` again (**this time not in dry run**). This submits the actual Liquibase-Pro version to the Marketplace.

### :crystal_ball: Run Task definitions

1. NOTE: it is going to take a while for the new version to be approved. Approximate 30mins.
2. Run the workflow file `run-task-definitions.yml` with the test image tag

3. After the workflow is successfully run, the `test_tag` version should be restricted as part of the workflow.NOTE: it is going to take a while for the version to be restricted. Approximate 15mins.

# :ship: Deploy the actual listing after testing

1.**After testing** run the workflow [deploy-extension-to-marketplace.yml](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-aws-license-service/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-extension-to-marketplace.yml) with actual value eg: `4.31.0` with **disabled** "Run this as dry run"

### :hammer: (If required) Manually test liquibase commands with the Marketplace listing

1. We have a `LiquibaseAWSMP` AWS account where we have listed the extension in the AWS Marketplace.
2. All the QA's and Dev's should have access to this account.
3. We have AWS Fargate Cluster called `aws-mp-test-cluster` setup in this account where we can run the Liquibase commands.
4. Most of the liquibase commands should already be defined under `Task Definitions` section in the ECS Cluster.
5. All you do is navigate to `Tasks` tab, `Run New Task`, under `Family` select the task definition you want to run, and then click on `Create`.

   ![](./image/run_task.png)

6. You can also run the task using the `aws-cli` command.
   ```bash
   aws ecs run-task --cluster aws-mp-test-cluster --task-definition update-liquibase
   ```
7. To check logs of the task, click on the task you just ran under `Tasks` tab. And then navigate to `Logs` tab.

8. To add more commands to test in the `aws-mp-test-cluster`, you can add them in the `Task Definitions` section.
9. Contact the DevOps team to get access to the `LiquibaseAWSMP` AWS account or any other help required.

# :sparkles: New version of `liquibase-aws-license-service`

1. We release a new version of `liquibase-aws-license-service` only when it is required, as this is a SECURE extension.
2. When there is a new `liquibase-aws-license-service` version release, the dependabot in LPM(liquibase package manager) repository creates a PR: example : https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-package-manager/pull/430/files#diff-0b0a9d274bd84c7dbfff4680de10599cd0d96458b06b74a925b2bcd3e3fc2fadR15. We need to **manually** merge the PR. Make sure to review and merge the PR before proceeding.

# Liquibase AWS License Service Extension

This Docker image provides a pre-configured Liquibase Secure environment with the AWS License Service extension installed for use in AWS Marketplace environments.

## üèóÔ∏è Docker Image Architecture

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build approach to create a clean, secure final image:

### Builder Stage

- **Base**: `liquibase/liquibase-secure:5.0.0`
- **Purpose**: Install and configure the AWS License Service extension
- **Components**:
  - Downloads and installs Liquibase Package Manager (LPM) v0.2.11
  - Uses LPM to install `liquibase-aws-license-service` extension
  - Supports both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures

### Final Stage  

- **Base**: Clean `liquibase/liquibase-secure:5.0.0` image
- **Purpose**: Provides production-ready Liquibase with AWS extension
- **Contains**: Only the AWS License Service JAR file (no LPM)
- **Security**: Minimal attack surface by excluding build tools

## üß™ Testing the Docker Image

### Build the Image

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t liquibase-aws-license-service .
```

### Verify Extension Installation

```bash
# Check that Liquibase loads the AWS extension
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service liquibase --version

# Expected output should include:
# - lib/liquibase-aws-license-service-X.X.X.jar: Liquibase AWS License Service Extension X.X.X By Liquibase
```

### Verify Clean Final Image

```bash
# Confirm LPM is NOT in the final image (should return empty/error)
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service which lpm

# Verify only extension JARs are present
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service ls -la /liquibase/lib/
```

### Test Liquibase Functionality

```bash
# Test basic Liquibase commands
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service liquibase --help

# Test with environment variable for AWS mode
docker run --rm -e DOCKER_AWS_LIQUIBASE=true liquibase-aws-license-service liquibase --help
```

### Interactive Testing

```bash
# Run container interactively for detailed testing
docker run -it --rm liquibase-aws-license-service /bin/bash

# Inside container, test various scenarios:
liquibase --version
env | grep DOCKER_AWS_LIQUIBASE
ls -la /liquibase/lib/
```

## üéØ Purpose and Benefits

### What This Image Achieves

1. **AWS Marketplace Integration**: Pre-configured for AWS Marketplace licensing
2. **Security**: Clean final image without build tools or package managers
3. **Performance**: Optimized layer caching with multi-stage builds
4. **Compliance**: Ensures only necessary components in production image

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **AWS License Service Extension**: Pre-installed and ready to use
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Architecture Support**: Works on both AMD64 and ARM64
- ‚úÖ **Secure Build**: Final image contains no build tools or LPM
- ‚úÖ **Environment Markers**: `DOCKER_AWS_LIQUIBASE=true` for identification
- ‚úÖ **Version Pinning**: Uses specific, tested versions of all components

## Automated Version Management

This repository uses Dependabot and GitHub Actions to automatically monitor and update the `liquibase-secure` Docker image version, ensuring that both the Dockerfile and pom.xml stay synchronized.

### 1. How it works

1. **Dependabot monitors** https://github.com/liquibase/docker/pkgs/container/liquibase-secure for new releases (daily)
2. **When a new version is available**, Dependabot creates a PR updating the Dockerfile:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM liquibase/liquibase-secure:X.Y.Z
   ```
3. **Automated workflow** (`dependabot-sync-and-merge.yml`) triggers on the Dependabot PR:
   - Extracts the new version from the Dockerfile
   - Updates `<liquibase-secure.version>` in pom.xml to match
   - Commits the change to the same Dependabot PR
   - Adds a comment showing the version sync
   - Auto-merges the PR after all checks pass

### 2. Configuration Files

- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Configures Dependabot to monitor Docker, Maven, and GitHub Actions
- `.github/workflows/dependabot-sync-and-merge.yml` - Syncs pom.xml version and auto-merges Dependabot PRs
