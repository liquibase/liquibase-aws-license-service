# Liquibase AWS License Service Extension

This Docker image provides a pre-configured Liquibase Secure environment with the AWS License Service extension installed for use in AWS Marketplace environments.

## üèóÔ∏è Docker Image Architecture

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build approach to create a clean, secure final image:

### Builder Stage

- **Base**: `liquibase/liquibase-secure:4.33.0`
- **Purpose**: Install and configure the AWS License Service extension
- **Components**:
  - Downloads and installs Liquibase Package Manager (LPM) v0.2.11
  - Uses LPM to install `liquibase-aws-license-service` extension
  - Supports both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures

### Final Stage  

- **Base**: Clean `liquibase/liquibase-secure:4.33.0` image
- **Purpose**: Provides production-ready Liquibase with AWS extension
- **Contains**: Only the AWS License Service JAR file (no LPM)
- **Security**: Minimal attack surface by excluding build tools

## üß™ Testing the Docker Image

### Build the Image

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t liquibase-aws-license-service .
```

### Verify Extension Installation

```bash
# Check that Liquibase loads the AWS extension
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service liquibase --version

# Expected output should include:
# - lib/liquibase-aws-license-service-X.X.X.jar: Liquibase AWS License Service Extension X.X.X By Liquibase
```

### Verify Clean Final Image

```bash
# Confirm LPM is NOT in the final image (should return empty/error)
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service which lpm

# Verify only extension JARs are present
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service ls -la /liquibase/lib/
```

### Test Liquibase Functionality

```bash
# Test basic Liquibase commands
docker run --rm liquibase-aws-license-service liquibase --help

# Test with environment variable for AWS mode
docker run --rm -e DOCKER_AWS_LIQUIBASE=true liquibase-aws-license-service liquibase --help
```

### Interactive Testing

```bash
# Run container interactively for detailed testing
docker run -it --rm liquibase-aws-license-service /bin/bash

# Inside container, test various scenarios:
liquibase --version
env | grep DOCKER_AWS_LIQUIBASE
ls -la /liquibase/lib/
```

## üéØ Purpose and Benefits

### What This Image Achieves

1. **AWS Marketplace Integration**: Pre-configured for AWS Marketplace licensing
2. **Security**: Clean final image without build tools or package managers
3. **Performance**: Optimized layer caching with multi-stage builds
4. **Compliance**: Ensures only necessary components in production image

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **AWS License Service Extension**: Pre-installed and ready to use
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Architecture Support**: Works on both AMD64 and ARM64
- ‚úÖ **Secure Build**: Final image contains no build tools or LPM
- ‚úÖ **Environment Markers**: `DOCKER_AWS_LIQUIBASE=true` for identification
- ‚úÖ **Version Pinning**: Uses specific, tested versions of all components

### Use Cases

- AWS Marketplace Liquibase deployments
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.)
- CI/CD pipelines requiring Liquibase with AWS licensing
- Development environments mimicking AWS Marketplace conditions

## :outbox_tray: Deploying the extension to Liquibase AWS Marketplace

1. We manually update the `liquibase-secure` version in pom.xml
2. The below steps run on every Liquibase Secure release.
   a. The dependabot.yml file checks for new versions of dependencies for package-ecosystem: "docker" and creates a pull request to update the dependencies, specifically for new version of liquibase-secure docker .
   b. The workflow file `dependabot-pr-merge-docker-changes.yml` auto merges the dependabot PR containing the new Docker Secure version.
   c. The deploy-extension-to-marketplace.yml file runs and publishes the `test` extension to the Liquibase AWS Marketplace.
